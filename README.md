### Flamethrower rehabilitation

This plugin addressess the issues with the flamethrower that were pointed out in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqaI5LhNalk

1. Disables Blue Moon rampup mechanics.
2. Reverses flame priority for dealing damage (damage is now based on youngest possible flame instead of oldest).
3. Introduces new heuristics for estimating flames density (which was the goal of the Blue Moon rampup mechanics) which is based on player's angular speed estimation.
